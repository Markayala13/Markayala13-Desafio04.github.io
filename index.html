                <p>The Gold Saints are the most powerful warriors serving the goddess Athena. They represent the twelve zodiac constellations and wear golden armor known as Gold Cloths, which provide them with immense protection and amplify their already extraordinary abilities. Each Gold Saint masters the energy of the universe, known as Cosmos, and can manipulate it to perform devastating attacks.

                    Gold Saints are guardians of the Twelve Temples of the Zodiac, located on the path leading to Athena's sanctuary. Their speed is unmatched, as they can move at the speed of light, and they possess incredible knowledge of their respective zodiac sign and its powers.</p>
